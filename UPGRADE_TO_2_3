# Merge copies non persisted properties too

When merging an entity in UoW not only mapped properties are copied, but also others.

# Metadata Driver refactoring

Metadata drivers have been rewritten to reuse code from Doctrine\Common.
This is mainly an internal refactoring, but anyone who is using the Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Driver\Driver interface explicitly should instead refer to Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Mapping\Driver\MappingDriver.
Same applies to Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Driver\AbstractFileDriver: you should now refer to Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Mapping\Driver\FileDriver.
